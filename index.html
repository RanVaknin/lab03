            <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif ">Hi! I'm Ran,
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm originally from Israel, in high school I was in a music class, I like to play jazz and funk.
                <br>
                I've served 3 years in the Israeli army as a combat artillery man both as a soldier and as a squadron commander.
                <br>
                Diamonds and jewelry used to be my whole life until a couple of months ago. I was a sales manager for a diamond wholesale company here in Seattle,
                <br>
                and the best part of the job was that I got to travel throughout the northwest and meet amazing people and of course - make sales $$$
                <br>
                Nowdays Im focused on trying to secure a career in the tech field whether as a computer developer or a product management position that will benefit from my skills and ability to read and write code.
