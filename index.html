                    <li>I'm originally from Israel, in high school I was in a music class, I like to play jazz and funk.</li>
                    <li>I've served 3 years in the Israeli army as a combat artillery man both as a soldier and as a squadron commander.</li>
                    <li>Diamonds and jewelry used to be my whole life until a couple of months ago. I was a sales manager for a diamond wholesale company here in Seattle,
                    and the best part of the job was that I got to travel throughout the northwest and meet amazing people and of course - make sales $$$.</li>
                    <li>Nowdays Im focused on trying to secure a career in the tech field whether as a computer developer or a product management position that will benefit from my skills and ability to read and write code.</li>
